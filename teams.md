# Teams, empathy, emotional intelligence and facilitation

I think we have an expectation that groups of people should just work well together by default. And when they don't we look to blame individuals.
Actually I think groups are subject to some kind of 'empathy decay' over time. It takes ongoing effort to maintain empathy in a team to keep it working well.

I've spent the last year and a half working at EDA as a facilitator where I taught people to write code and work in a team.
A huge part of the course revolves around learning to work in a team. Students have group projects every week and the last week of the course is a week long group project.
At a quick guess I'd say I've seen maybe 20 - 30 teams work on an intense week long project. I've seen some amazing teams have life changing, uplifting experiences. There were some disasters too but mostly not. One of my favourite parts of the job was the crazy alchemy of personalities that goes into how a group behaves. 

Here's what I learned from seeing all these groups:

Managers are better if they act as servants / facilitators who have an 'ear' for the group and can intervene.
  - what does a happy group look like? unhappy?
  - what does an intervention look like? how do you do it?

- Cultivate connection and trust. 
  - 'Team building' has a bad name but done well it's magic.
  - Take time to build empathy amongst the group members. 
    - Check in. At the start of the day. At the start of meetings.
    - just like me
    - if you really knew me
    - listening and looping
    - speed backing.

- Have difficult conversations often. Nothing kills empathy like resentment.

- Practise being vulnerable often. Nothing breeds empathy like seeing people being vulnerable.

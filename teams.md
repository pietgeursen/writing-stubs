# Teams, empathy, emotional intelligence and facilitation

I think we have an expectation that groups of people should just work well together by default. And when they don't we look to blame individuals.
Actually I think groups are subject to some kind of 'empathy decay' over time. It takes ongoing effort to maintain empathy in a team to keep it working well.

I've spent the last year and a half working at EDA as a facilitator where I taught people to write code and work in a team.
A huge part of the course revolves around learning to work in a team. Students have group projects every week and the last week of the course is a week long group project.
At a quick guess I'd say I've seen maybe 20 - 30 teams work on an intense week long project. I've seen some amazing teams have life changing, uplifting experiences. There were some disasters too but mostly not.

So here's what I learned from seeing all these groups:

- Managers should act as servants / facilitators who have an 'ear' for the group and can intervene.

- Have difficult conversations often. Nothing kills empathy like resentment.

- Cultivate connection and trust. 
  - 'Team building' has a bad name but done well it's magic.
  - Take time to build empathy amongst the group members. 
    - just like me
    - if you really knew me
    - listening and looping
    - speed backing.

# Anxiety

How I went from pretty debilitating social anxiety to teaching in front of classes and loving it.
  - Sharing what has worked for me. 
    - Even if that doesn't work for you, at least know that you can change your situation.

- My experiences
  - social anxiety
  - hating being the centre of attention
  - speaking in front of people
    - standups
    - introduction circles
    - little presentations at work
  - avoiding social situations
    - wanting to contribute / be involved / go to meetups but being too 'scared'

- What changed?
  - Learned some basic mindfulness
  - Read some buddhism
  - Got a prescription of SSRIs
  - Did a coding bootcamp with a large focus on personal skills, teams, empathy, inner critic
  - took the long view, informed by the idea of brain plasticity.

# Projects vs Tutorials

Or why code tutorials are the devil.

- who is the target audience?
- does an experienced developer learn differently to a junior

What I've seen
- Saw students trying to teach themselves a new tech and leaning on tutorials
  - After finishing the tutorial it might work but the next day they don't have the new technology in their heads. 
  - Unable to translate what they did in the tutorial to a new domain.

Why doesn't it work?
- illusion of learning. It's too easy to copy paste line by line.
- Saw students 'hiding' by doing a tutorial. 
  - comfort of seeing code on the screen when their basic coding was not up to the task of learning the new technology at all.
- Often doesn't point at the documentation and teach you to read it.
- Takes you down the happy path of everything working without pulling things apart, not like live coding.

- Being able to use a technology is like lego. You need to know how the pieces fit together. 

What are different approaches?

- Advice for people trying to learn to code / juniors.
  - power of 'kata'
    - pick a different domain and translate the tutorial to that domain. 
      - stops you copy pasting at the very least.
  - Work with the documentation for the technology open. You should be trying to link what you're seeing in the tutorial back to the documentation.

- Advice for people making tutorials?
  - Refer to the documentation in the tutorial! Being a teacher is about translating. Translate the docs for the reader. If you do your job right the reader will never have to look at your tutorial again because they can read the docs.
